	similar way we do with patterns
	we can build a plugin concept

	The idea of the plugin concept is to be more powerful comparing to patterns
	for an example pattern cane be used for read/count purposes
	plugin can be used extract output and generate output html files

	etc..

	This is for future extendability of the app - not for this immediate use-case
